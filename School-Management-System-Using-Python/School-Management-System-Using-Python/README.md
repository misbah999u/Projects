School Management Systems encompass the comprehensive organization of student and faculty data within a specific educational institution. In our endeavor, we will utilize this system to effectively handle fundamental personal information concerning the students enrolled in the school.

Essential Components for Project Implementation

To embark on this project, we will necessitate the utilization of the following libraries:
1. **Tkinter** - Primarily employed for constructing the graphical user interface (GUI).
2. **SQLite3** - Vital for establishing connectivity between the program and the database, facilitating seamless information storage.
3. **TkCalendar** - Essential for enabling users to input dates conveniently.
4. **Datetime.date** - Crucial for converting date data into a Datetime.date instance, thereby enabling its integration within the system.
5. **Tkinter.messagebox** - Indispensable for presenting informative or error messages via display boxes.
6. **Tkinter.ttk** - Integral for crafting the tree structure, pivotal for displaying comprehensive information within the system.
