(Natural Language Toolkit)NLTK: NLTK is a popular open-source package in Python. Rather than building all tools from scratch, NLTK provides all common NLP Tasks.
Installing NLTK
Type !pip install nltk in the Jupyter Notebook or if it doesnâ€™t work in cmd type conda install -c conda-forge nltk. This should work in most cases.
Install NLTK: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk
Importing NLTK Library

After typing the above, we get an NLTK Downloader Application which is helpful in NLP Tasks

Stopwords Corpus is already installed in my system which helps in removing redundant repeated words. Similarly, we can install other useful packages.
