If approved, this will be the third vaccine to be used in India after Serum Institute of India Covishield - developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca - and Bharat Biotech Covaxin.Sputnik V, manufactured in India by Dr Reddy s, has the highest effectiveness - 91.6 per cent -- after the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Dr Reddy s had applied on February 19 for emergency use of the vaccine, which is in Phase 3 of clinical trials in India.After the recommendation of the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, the vaccine has to be greenlit by the Drug Controller General of India before it can be widely used to inoculate citizens. Sputnik V has made it to the top of the queue amid complaints of vaccine shortage from many states, especially Maharashtra, the epicenter of the second surge of Covid.'],\"label\":['REAL']}\n",

A private research report suggests that the unemployment rate has started rising since April.Data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai-based think tank, suggested that unemployment has again started rising in the country. The unemployment rate touched 8.6 per cent for the week ending April 11, from just 6.7 per cent two weeks ago, according to fresh data released by CMIE.With migrant labourers retreating to their native places, the impact seems to be more severe in urban areas where the unemployment rate is now reaching 10 per cent.Maharashtra, which has been reporting the highest number of cases in India, was the first to announce partial lockdown measures. State authorities said that a decision on a complete lockdown will be taken this week.Other states have also imposed restrictions like night curfews and may soon opt for stricter measures if average daily cases continue to rise rapidly.',\"label\":'REAL'}"
